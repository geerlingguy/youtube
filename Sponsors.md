# Sponsor and Vendor Relationships

This document contains a listing of all sponsors and equipment providers/vendors with whom I've interacted.

I believe in transparency with vendors, with sponsors, and most especially with my _viewers_, so I hope this document can serve as a public record to assist when there may be implied or real _Conflict of Interest_ for certain software or hardware I use or mention in any of my videos.

Sponsors and vendors are listed in alphabetical order.

> **NOTE**: I don't always remember to update this document! If you see a sponsor on my channel that's not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/youtube/issues) and ask about it. I'm not trying to hide anything, I just have a lot going on and am quite forgetful sometimes :)

## 45Drives

> Type: Equipment

45Drives provided a Storinator XL60, as well as 60 20 TB Seagate Exos Hard Drives, in support of my 'Petabyte Pi' project (and follow-up videos).

45Drives also hosted me (providing boarding and transportation) for their 2023 Creator Summit in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

## Ampere Computing (+ ADLINK, + System76)

> Type: Equipment for test/review

Ampere Computing has aided my work testing and reviewing various arm64 applications, most notably providing hardware through their partner companies at various points.

I currently have a number of Ampere-based arm64 test systems on somewhat-permanent loan:

  - ADLINK Ampere Altra Dev Workstation
  - ADLINK Ampere Altra Dev Kit
  - System76 Thelio Astra Workstation
  - Supermicro AmpereOne 2U Server

## Apcsilmic

> Type: Equipment for test/review

Apcsilmic sent an arm64 Dot 1 Mini PC running Windows 11 for review.

## AirGradient

> Type: Equipment for test/review

After purchasing some of their DIY kids and testing them, AirGradient reached out and partnered with me to test some of their early prebuilt hardware. After launching the hardware for public sale, they have sent six or so of their various prebuilt air quality sensors (indoor and outdoor), and some of these I have reviewed and tested in videos on Geerling Engineering and the Jeff Geerling channel.

I have been supporting their hardware with my own open source projects for a few years, and through my and the community's persuasion, they have added on Home Assistant integration into their default firmware.

## Ansible (by Red Hat / IBM)

> Type: Channel for book sales

Ansible provided space for me to sell my book at an early AnsibleFest conference, and have featured my book in some of their marketing materials.

## ArduCam

> Type: Equipment for test/review

ArduCam makes a variety of camera sensors and hardware compatible with the Raspberry Pi. They have sent various models of Pi camera modules to me over the years, and I have a small box with all the gear they've sent.

Some of their cameras and Pi products are used in other projects I build (for example, an all-sky camera, or a CinePi build).

## Arm

> Type: Paid sponsorship, travel reimbursement

## ASUSTOR

> Type: Equipment for test/review

ASUSTOR has provided a few NAS systems for my testing and review. I currently use three of their NASes for backup purposes or ongoing / long-term testing in the studio and in my home.

They have been great about receiving feedback from me and the community, and have implemented some features like SMB Multichannel, ECC memory support in consumer NASes, and other software features after community interaction. I provide my advice for future storage products from time to time, as I do other storage vendors.

## CutiePi

> Type: Equipment for test/review

CutiePi sent a CutiePi tablet based on the Pi CM4, for my testing and review.

## DFRobot

> Type: Equipment for test/review

DFRobot has provided a few small Raspberry Pi Compute Module-based boards for testing and review.

## Elecrow

> Type: Equipment for test/review, compensation for stolen voice

I received a CrowPi2 for review early in my YouTube channel's history, and generally have had a good relationship with Elecrow. Their unauthorized use of my cloned voice in 2024 soured that relationship, but we found an acceptable compromise involving compensation and a donation to charity.

## Flexispot

> Type: Paid sponsorship

Some time after purchasing two of their small height-adjustable desks on Amazon, Flexispot reached out for a sponsorship on a video while I was building out my office. I accepted a desk and chair on trade, along with a reduced sponsorship rate on one video.

Working with them was fine, but they do tend to reach out multiple times a year for various campaigns, with different representatives each time (sometimes multiple emails in the same week!). They were fine, and their hardware works great (I've since bought two more Flexispot desks), but they can be a little aggressive in their pitch!

## GeeekPi (DeskPi / 52Pi)

> Type: Equipment for test/review

I've been in contact with GeeekPi/DeskPi/52Pi quite often, as their products often align with my own projects. I tested and provided early feedback for their DeskPi Super6C CM4 cluster, and have encouraged them to build out a 10" mini rack ecosystem for Homelab use.

They have provided a number of mini racks and accessories, as well as one Super6C cluster + enclosure, and a number of small Pi HATs, Pi cases, and Compute Module boards for testing and review.

## KubeSail (PiBox)

> Type: Equipment for test/review

KubeSail provided two PiBox NASes for test and reviewâ€”and I liked them so much I gave one away and purchased another during their Kickstarter!

## Linus Tech Tips (LTT)

> Type: Equipment for test/review, travel reimbursement

Linus Tech Tips sponsored my flight and hotel for LTX 2023, and also provided one LTT Screwdriver, one LTT Precision Screwdriver, and one LTT Stubby Screwdriver for testing.

I have separately purchased 5 other LTT Screwdrivers, including the two I used in my initial review video.

## Meta (Facebook)

> Type: Equipment for test/review

Meta provided some timing hardware for my Time Pi project and for general PTP and GPS timing tests with Raspberry Pis. They have also provided a used Tektronics Oscilloscope for use in these timing experiments, because the one I had access to did not have sufficient performance for nanosecond-scale measurement.

## Micro Center

> Type: Paid sponsorship, travel reimbursement

Micro Center has sponsored a number of videos on my channel, including one where I flew out to Charlotte, NC, for their grand opening.

They have been a very reliable and easy to work with sponsor, typically allowing me complete freedom to work on a project that integrates well with the products they sell in stores. Their staff has been some of the most helpful (with or without sponsorship) and I started shopping at their store in St. Louis well before I started accepting any sponsorships!

## Mirkotronics

> Type: Equipment for test/review

Mirkotronics provided a MirkoPC for testing with the Raspberry Pi Compute Module, and I have provided feedback about CM boards to Mirek, the founder, on numerous occasions. Mirek has taken a lot of community feedback into account in designing revisions to his projects.

## MyElectronics.nl

> Type: Equipment for test/review

MyElectronics provided a series of Raspberry Pi, Mac mini, and Mini ITX rackmount enclosures, some of which I use to this day in my equipment racks.

They have taken customer feedback into account designing new products for the SMB and homelab space.
